check Web Dev II folder for info on buttons

fix the div contents going outside it's border on solutionsgrid / gridception

job's done!

add a feature where you can insert extra button next to ^20 by clicking a button(with a + icon),
a flexbox possibly, inserting afterbegin with increments of 1 starting with 21, 22,...

use case: person may want to know how much 2^28 is for instance

also add a reset button to clear all the added buttons except ^20

add: string next to the return button on power of add that shows the number of the button that was pressed

TODO:

in page1(index) add the posibility to type in the value of power X and an extra button

as a small text inputfield ([value X = ][          ]) between brackets
                           [calc button]

have minimal CSS for the extra calc feature, add it below the blue output window, output
the data in the blue window too, don't reset the typed x value
